# Portfolio-Project

## Description

This is my completed sample portfolio repository for the UC Berkeley eDX Bootcamp's challenge for Week 2: Advanced CSS. I completed this challenge not only to show my understanding of advanced HTML, CSS, and Git programming, but also to establish a one-page portfolio website that I can update and utilize in the future.

This repository contains the original web portfolio one pager consisting of HTML and CSS. Advanced CSS techniques are utilized, including Flexbox and Media Queries. The website displays my name, picture, bio, some recent projects I have created, and a contact section.

From this, I not only further reinforced my knowledge of HTML/CSS/Git programming, but strengthened my UI/UX design knowledge as well, as the project required me to design the webpage from scratch. In terms of utility, I now have a portfolio website that I can continue to refine and add to as I continue my developer career.
